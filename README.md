# Introduction
In the past, to do object recognition using computers, many classifiers have been developed, such as Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors. But with the improvement of the computing power, recent years people start to use artificial neural networks to solve object recognition problems, such as Back Propagation Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network.

In this project, our goal is to create object recognition systems which can identify which given object catagory is the best match. We built several supervised learning models with different algorithms and tried to analysis their performance.

We used [Caltech256](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/) as our dataset, which is a challenging set of 256 object categories containing a total of 30607 images, taken at varying orientations, varying lighting conditions, and with different backgrounds.
